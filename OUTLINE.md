By Monday, April 27th, I would like to have a working code for the system of equations. Ultimately, this means I will have a working
function that plots the relationships between the two animals in question. I would also like to make a quality docstring for my paper and
figure out how to test it like the step in the reading explained.

The equations:
dx/dt = ax-bxy    and        dy/dt = cxy-dy
will be the functions that I will be using to model my predator vs prey system.
This system of equations shows that the prey reproduces at a rate that is dependent on their population, but are eaten by the predator at a rate proportional to both the predator and preyâ€™s population. a, b, c, and d are constants.
