# Final-Project-Predator-vs.-Prey-Model
This repository will contain code and other files that are related to my final project.

At the moment, there is no code done to describe what job it is completing. However, I imagine that there will be a fourth order runge kutta method including constants, initial values, intervals, and differential equations that will plot a solution to those differential equations.
